            <h1>Unity Starter Project</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome all. This is the Unity introduction for the CSU AR/VR Club.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this is to familarize
                you with Unity, the currently prefered VR/AR platform with native support for multiple headsets. Over
                the course of these you will become able to install Unity, add assets, manipulate enviroments, and -
                should you chosse to - script using C#. After learing these basics you will have the knowlege base and
                skills required to expand in Unity development. The last piece will be a guide on how to port your
                program to an Oculus and some basics for the tools that the Oculus library gives you on Unity.
            </p>

            <p>We hope you enjoy and if you are finding this for the first time and are interested, Meetings are every
                Friday 5pm - 6pm in the CS Building room 130 or you can reach out to one of our officers here.
            </p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <p>Included in this repository are three project files organized by level of difficulty for every new
                members to try and dip their toe into Unity, or pique their personal interests. All you have to do is
                download the repository, as a zip file, from the green "Code" tab to have access to the Unity files</p>

            <h3>Level 1: Introduction to the Unity UI and scripting (Unity version 2020.3.21f1 REQUIRE)</h3>

            <p>This is a beginning project for everyone who's new to Unity and would like to see what the game engine is
                like. The image below should be what you see.</p>

            <img src="../img/posts/unity-starter-project/Hu9EfT0.webp" alt="add-level-1-screenshot">

            <ul>
                <li>There are already premade assets, donwnloaded from the Unity asset store for player to grab and
                    implement them in the world</li>
                <li>
                    Scripting has already been done to control the car with collision mechanics
                    <ul>
                        <li>Player can drive the car into the boxes using WASD keys</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    For more comprehensive instruction on how to get started
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="">Click the link</a> and follow the instruction step by step</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Level 2: Apply what you learned (Unity version 2020.3.21f1 REQUIRE)</h3>

            <p>
                This level will require you to apply what you've learned in the previous level to fix a level. Click on
                the "Challenge 1" folder then the "Challenge 1" UNITY file within that folder to open up the scene
            </p>

            <img src="../img/posts/unity-starter-project/OWuisof.webp" alt="level-2-project">

            <ul>
                <li>This project file will be the same as that from Level 1 but will have an additional file called
                    "Challenge 1"</li>
                <li>
                    "Challenge 1" will have a similar script and collision mechanic as the previous but its code is
                    broken and wrong
                    <ul>
                        <li>This includes bad camera angle, poor movement and bad control</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your job is to fix the flaws in the mechanics and control to get the level into a playable state
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Level 3: Unity challenge, create your own level (Unity version 2020.3.21f1 REQUIRE)</h3>

            <p>
                This last level repisotory is for those who would want to expand on what they know to create their own
                level in the FPS genre. Simply open the file in the "Unity hub" and you should see something similar to
                the image below.
            </p>

            <img src="../img/posts/unity-starter-project/9bqk0Jx.webp" alt="level-3-project">

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This project file is different from the first two in that it is a game geared toward the First
                    Person Shooter genre
                </li>
                <li>
                    All there is needed to do is for you to create your own level, add movement to the enemy and
                    whatever you wish to create your own FPS level
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unity also provides a set of instruction on getting started on your FPS game
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="">
                            Click this link
                        </a>
                        and follow its instructions
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
